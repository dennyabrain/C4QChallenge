# IP Block Coding Challenge

I made this using Android Studio and these were the commands I used to run the program.

make sure you are in the working director - app/src/main/java

**javac c4q/nyc/javalesson/Main.java c4q/nyc/javalesson/IPAddress.java**

to check whether an IP is in the block
**java c4q.nyc.javalesson.Main 12.23.34.45/15 12.22.35.44**

to enumerate all IPs in a block
**java c4q.nyc.javalesson.Main 12.23.34.45/29**
